# Internet-feeds

This is a database of Internet feeds. Just unzip <b>feeds.zip</b>!

The archive contains a SQLite database, generated from various curated link collections 
 - (e.g. the https://github.com/rumca-js/Internet-Places-Database project)

 You can open the database with any SQLite tool.

# Data

```
Table: linkdatamodel, Row count: 55755
```

How can your page, or RSS feed enter this database? Well...

 - first it needs to be on the internet. Available, scrapable (title and stuff needs to be there)
 - it needs to wait, until it is picked up by scrapers
 - only feeds with a great amount of attention and recognition are part of this database
